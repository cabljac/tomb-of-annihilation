## Summary

Our adventure began at the funeral of **Bubbles**, a dear mutual friend of the party. Bubbles, once a lively cleric, had succumbed to the _"Death Curse"_ - a mysterious plague preying on those who had once been ressurected from beyond the grave.

After some touching and unique eulogies, the group were approached by an golden-haired elf and a mysterious masked individual. **Remalia Haventree** (the elf) explained she was leader of a group of Harpers, and she required the help of a group of able adventurers. The masked individual identified herself as **Syndra Silvane**, an ex-adventurer. Syndra's voice sounded croaky and weak from behind her mask. It seemed she suffered from the effects of the Death Curse herself.

The plan was to lay seige to the lair of a powerful Lich - **Zaldara Cordress** (also known as the **Duchess of Rot**). Whilst the seige was underway, the party would sneak into the basement of the lair and steal the phylactory of the Lich, providing bargaining power against her. The hope was to interrogate Zaldara for information on the death curse.

After agreeing to take part in this seige-heist, the group set sail with **Callabrax**, a friendly halfing mage. On the 3rd day of their journey they arrived at caves below the lair of the Lich. Callabrax revealed a secret entrance, and on signal from Remalia, the heist began.

The dungeons of the Lich were no safe place, teeming the undead and magical traps. It was here that **Trini** met her demise, her life drained from her by the guardian of the Lich's vault - a horrific spectre. Trini's death was not in vain however, as it was her who had release the pseudodragon Elonast who revealed the location of Zaldara's Vault. With the phylactory of the Lich in their possession, the rest of the party escaped the dungeon and were teleported by Callabrax to a wounded Remalia.

With an eldritch crackle, the Duchess of Rot appeared before the group. She was badly injured too, but easily overcame the elf with her magic. Holding her phylactory to ransom, the group bargained with Zaldara for the information they sought, and the freedom of Elonast the pseudodragon, her old familiar. The party found out that the source of the Death Curse lay somewhere on the Isle of _Chult_, and was due to a device Zaldara called the 'Soulmonger'.

The party then made their way out of the Cloakwood forest, resting up in the tent of Syndra Silvane, who had stayed clear of the seige.
