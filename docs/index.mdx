# Campaign Notes - Tomb of Annihilation


If you're from Wizards of the Coast and something i've written here infringes on your copyright, the best way to let me know is actually to raise an issue in the repository where i'm keeping this content, [here](https://github.com/cabljac/tomb-of-annihilation).

Otherwise if you're my players in this campaign, feel free to browse the site. There shouldn't be any spoilers here.

I'll use this website to keep summaries of sessions from my perspective.
